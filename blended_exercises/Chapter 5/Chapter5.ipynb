    "As we saw in Chapter 4, correlation is a measure of how much two variables are related. This means that as one variable increases, so do the values of the other variable, or perhaps the other variable decreases as one increases.  This is simple to estimate if both variables have a Guassian distribution, but if we do not know if this is the case, we need to use non parametric methods.\n",

    "Spearman's rank correlation coefficient can be defined as a special case of the Pearson $r$ applied to ranked (sorted) variables. Unlike Pearson, Spearman's correlation is not restricted to linear relationships. Instead, it measures monotonic association (only strictly increasing or decreasing, but not mixed) between two variables and relies on the rank order of values. In other words, rather than comparing means and variances, Spearman's coefficient looks at the relative order of values for each variable. This makes it appropriate to use with both *continuous and discrete* data.\n",

    "Suppose we wish to know the range of gun. We could perform an experiment where we fire $n$ projectiles from the gun, and measure the distance $x$ at which the projectiles first make contact with the ground. In such case, due to the many, random uncertainties, it is natural to assume that the distribution $x$ will be normally spread around some central value $x_0$, with a standard deviation of $\\sigma$, such that the group of ranges $X = {x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n} = N(x_0, \\sigma)$\n",

Useful things including reading in datafiles from experiments or telescopes, plotting data, plotting error bars, calculating some useful statistics, and perhaps probabilities, and fit models (lines/curves) to the data.  Python is really useful because we can *import* packages that already have built in tools to make publication quality plots, or estimate the mean or median and so on. These packages include  Numerical Python `numpy` and Scientific Python `SciPy` as well as plotting packages such as `Matplotlib`.   \n",

You do not need to be an experienced programmer, since there are some easy hints and tips that will allow you to do things in a simple way.
